This is the font I want to use for the website. They can be changed later by updating a custom css file.

From Gemini:Option B: Custom CSS File (Recommended): Create a new file (e.g., assets/css/custom.css), link it in the <head> after the main stylesheet, and put your rules there. This keeps your changes separate and organized.

    Excellent choiceâ€”that combo is classy, modern, and deeply readable. Playfair Display gives your headers a literary gravity (perfect for your systems-and-stories voice), while Inter keeps everything grounded and accessible, especially on mobile.

    Here are a couple quick tips to make the most of that pairing:

    ðŸ”§ Styling Suggestions
    Headings (Playfair Display):

    Use uppercase with letter-spacing for nav or section titles if you want that editorial feel.

    Keep weights at 500â€“700 for strong, elegant titles without being shouty.

    Consider italic or light for pull quotes or subheadingsâ€”itâ€™s got a beautiful italic.

    Body text (Inter):

    Stick to 400 or 500 weight for paragraphs.

    Set line height to 1.5â€“1.7 for comfortable reading.

    Use 16â€“18px size for essay content; Inter was designed for this sweet spot.

    âœ¨ Bonus Detail
    If you want to add just a hint of flair, consider using Playfair Display Italic for intros or quote callouts like:

    "We build systems to surviveâ€”but itâ€™s in the margins we remember who we are."

    It gives a soft voice-of-God vibe, without being overdramatic.
